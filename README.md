# C - Binary Trees

## Description

This Holberton School project delves into the concept and implementation of binary trees in C.
It covers the creation, manipulation, and traversal of binary trees,
highlighting various operations such as insertion, deletion, and search.
The project emphasizes understanding the structure and dynamics of binary trees,
including binary search trees (BSTs), AVL trees, and binary heaps.

## Project Requirements

- Editors Allowed: vi, vim, emacs.
- Compilation: All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
- Code Formatting: Code must adhere to the Betty style.
- Global Variables: No global variables are allowed.
- Functions Per File: A maximum of 5 functions per file.
- Standard Library: Use of the standard library is allowed.
- Function Prototypes: Must be included in the header file binary_trees.h.
- Header File Inclusion: All header files must be protected against multiple inclusions.
